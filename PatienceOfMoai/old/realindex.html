				<h2>What is Moai?</h2>
				<img src="images/moai_statue.jpg" alt="">
				<h3><br><b>Patience is POWER.</b></h3>
				<p>
					Moai is an procedually-generated low-poly open-world sandbox/exploration game. Your special power is the power of infinite patience. With the click of a button, you can fast-forward time and watch as the world around you changes before your eyes. The world has much to explore, such as environments that are out of this world, and mysterious shrines that may be complex to activate.
				</p>
				<p>
					You play as a Moai - more commonly known as an Easter Island statue. You've existed since the creation of the world and you still continue to exist - never changing, never aging. Unlike you, the world around you changes constantly - mountains rise and fall, oceans overflow and dry up, forests sprout and die. Explore the vast world that you've been placed in and experience the magic that the living, breathing world has to show you.

					<h2>We are Eggy Interactive.</h2>
					<p>
						Hi there! We're Eggy Interactive, a group of students in the University of California, Santa Cruz's undergraduate Game Design program. We put our hearts and souls into making games, and nothing we put out is anything other than the best that we can offer. Moai is the biggest game project any of us have ever tackled and we hope that the result is just as big and even more amazing.
