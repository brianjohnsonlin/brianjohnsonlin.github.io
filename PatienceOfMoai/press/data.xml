		<history>
			<header>Early history</header>
			<text>Brian Lin, our Lead Designer came up with the idea for Moai.  He got inspiration for the game from the webcomic GunnerKrigg Court.  There was a character that was a timeless being, who had been on the Earth since the beginning of the world and could not die.  The idea was to make a game about a being like this, that could see time fly by them and the world change around them.  The Moai (Easter Island statue) seemed to fit the idea of a timeless being that was needed for the game.  The team met and formed in college to bring the idea of Moai to life.</text>

			<text>For around the past year the team has been working hard on Moai.  On April 22nd, 2016 we had our Alpha Release of the game, and had a Closed Beta Release in May of 2016.  The game had its final release on June 3rd, 2016.</text>
